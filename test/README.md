# `/test`

Additional external test apps and test data. Feel free to structure the `/test` directory anyway you want. For bigger projects it makes sense to have a data subdirectory (e.g., `/test/data`).

Examples:

* https://github.com/openshift/origin/tree/master/test (test data is in the `/testdata` subdirectory)
